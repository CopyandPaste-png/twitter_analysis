To use the tool:

* Download the code
* Open the command terminal and cd to wherever you put the folder
* Run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt"
* Run the script- "python data.py"
* It will ask you to input a file- input the absolute path of the .csv file. I would open this program in VScode as it's easy to get the absolute path from there
